# BinTreeSorter
**Bintree Sorter using prolog**

## Features
 - **empty_bintree: It should return true if this is an empty binary tree**
 - **bintree_contains: Evaluate true iff Key is equal to the key of any node in the binary tree Tree. If Key is a variable on the call, it should unify to the key of a node in Tree. And unify to each key of each node in Tree via backtracking.**
 - **bintree_sum: Takes two arguments, Tree and Sum, in that order. The former argument is input, the latter output or input. Sum should be unified to the sum of the keys of the nodes in Tree**
 - **is_bintree_ordered: Takes one argument Tree. It should evaluate true iff the Tree has the property of being ordered. That is, if one did a left-to-right in-order traversal of Tree, the keys are in order ascending, allowing for duplicate key values.**
